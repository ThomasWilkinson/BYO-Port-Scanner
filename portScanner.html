		<p>While this web app cannot do all of those things listed above, this CAN scan ports and trace routes... Please enter in what hosts and ports you would like to scan below:<p>

		<p><i>Please note that these fields currently only accept numbers, hyphens, commas, periods, and backspaces. This is to make the input as easy to handle as possible for the python backend.</i></p>

		  Host(s):<br>
		  <input type="text" size=50 name="hosts" placeholder="'192.168.207.29, 192.168.207.119' or '192.168.207.2-254'">
		  <br>
		  Please put in IP addresses. You can use CIDR addressings, hyphenated ranges, or a comma delimted list. (comma and then a space afterwards). You can also do all three at the same time assuming you comma-space delimit them.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Ports:<br>
		  <input type="text" name="ports" placeholder="'22-80' or '22, 80, 119, 1024'">
		  <br>
		  Ports can be a list of comma delimited list of numbers or a range. Note that the the more there are and the bigger the range, the longer it will take to run. I've also noticed that because this is a TCP port scan the closed ports take a while to respond.
